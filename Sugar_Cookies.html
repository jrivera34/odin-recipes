      <p>My favorite halloween sugar cookies!.</p>
      <h1>Ingredients</h1>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>Baking Powder</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <p>Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes while you turn on the oven, prep your baking sheets, and gather your cookie cutters. By the time you're ready to roll, the dough will be easier to handle. Dust your countertop and rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll the dough into an even thickness, about ¼ to ½ inch. Dip the sharp edge of your cookie cutter into flour and cut out shapes. Place them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving an inch or more of space between the cutouts. This space allows the dough to spread slightly and the hot oven air to circulate around each cookie for even baking</p>
